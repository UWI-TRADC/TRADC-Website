			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Keep Introductions and Project Summary Short:</strong> Limit introductions and project summaries to less than 20 seconds. Avoid spending too much time on backstory.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Crop Out Needless Waiting Time:</strong> Remove unnecessary waiting time, such as Metamask TX confirmations, to keep the video focused.

			<li>
				<strong>Be Prepared for Form Filling or Switching Between Views:</strong> Have forms or views ready in multiple tabs to ensure a smooth transition during the demo.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Use Slides to Summarize Key Information:</strong> Utilize slides to present key information in a clear and organized manner.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Limit Bullet Points on Slides:</strong> Don't use more than 4 bullet points per slide to maintain clarity and avoid overwhelming the audience.
